This project utilizes hand tracking techniques to track and detect the user's hand in real-time. It provides a web-based interface where users can perform hand gestures, and the system recognizes and interprets those gestures.

Features

-> Real-time hand tracking and detection.
-> Gesture recognition based on hand movements
-> Display of recognized gestures
-> Web-based interface for easy interaction

Technologies Used

-> Python: The core programming language used for the project.
-> Flask: A lightweight web framework used for creating the web-based interface.
-> OpenCV: A computer vision library used for image and video processing.
-> HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end technologies used for creating the user interface.
-> MediaPipe: A cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied ML pipelines, used for hand tracking and gesture recognition.

Project Development

During the project development, I faced various challenges that significantly contributed to my growth as a developer. One of the major challenges I encountered was related to routing and mapping specific URLs to their corresponding functionalities. This required a deep understanding of the project and forced me to think critically to devise effective solutions. By overcoming these challenges, I not only improved my problem-solving skills but also gained valuable insights into the intricacies of URL routing.

Working with APIs was another complex aspect of the project. Converting a raw Python script into a functional API and seamlessly integrating it into my website required careful consideration and meticulous implementation. This experience exposed me to new technologies and expanded my knowledge of interfacing techniques. I gained a better understanding of how data is transferred between the client-side and server-side components, improving my skills in client-server communication.

Moreover, the project played a crucial role in enhancing my debugging skills. I encountered errors and issues during the development process, which prompted me to effectively identify and resolve them. This experience taught me how to tackle bugs and optimize the code for better performance.

By overcoming these challenges, I was able to develop a comprehensive understanding of web application development. I learned about the complexities involved in client-server interfacing, data transfer mechanisms, and the importance of optimizing code for efficient execution. These experiences have been invaluable in shaping my proficiency as a developer and have equipped me with the skills necessary to tackle similar challenges in future projects.
